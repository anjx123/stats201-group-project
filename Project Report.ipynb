    "## Introduction\n",
    "Relationships can often have positive impacts on people's mental and emotional health. This can boost stability and academic support, leading to higher GPAs **(Vaeth, 2009, p.7-8)**. On the other hand, it can also be time consuming and unhealthy, which can detract from a person's studies. This project seeks to answer the question of **whether a student's relationship status affects their academic performance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our [dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/higher-education-students-performance-evaluation) from 2019 contains information on 145 students in the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Educational Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. To answer our question, we will infer two parameters (the proportions of students with cumulative GPAs and expected GPAs above 3.0) on the populations of students who are in / not in relationships."

    "## Methods: Plan\n",
    "This report is trustworthy as it uses robust statistical frameworks to analyze the data. The hypothesis testing approach which includes bootstrapping to obtain confidence intervals ensures that the conclusions drawn are statistically significant and not due to random chance. In addition, the report uses data collected by a reputable source UCI's Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Educational Sciences students which gives credit that the sample was taken without bias and representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our preliminary analysis, we see that students with a partner have a higher mean cumulative and expected GPA in the sample than students who do not. However, this would not be sufficient evidence to provide to a stakeholder and declare that having a partner is better for student's GPA. This is because plots do not tell us whether the observed differences are statistically significant as they do not provide a confidence interval to show us how precise our estimates are. Therefore, there’s a risk of drawing inaccurate conclusions due to the inherent randomness of sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Our plan moving forward\n",
    "To address these gaps, we will conduct a hypothesis test using the infer package. The framework will be roughly as such\n",
    "```r  \n",
    "dataset |> specify |> hypothesize_with_independence |> generate_using_permute |> calculate_the_diff_in_mean |> get_ci |> Graph the bootstrap distribution and confidence interval\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Then we will use `\n",
    "get_p_value()\n",
    "`\n",
    "with direction set to both sides to get the p_value and compare it to a chosen significance level to see whether we should reject the null hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping to obtain the confidence interval (CI) results in fewer assumptions on the data and can be simply obtained by using `get_ci` in the infer package. \n",
    "Asymptotics relies on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) which relies on having a sufficiently sized data set that is not heavily skewed. In this case, It would be alright to use the asymptotic method as the dataset is sufficiently large (counts 84 for no partner and 64 for yes partner), and the difference in mean being a sum of values from the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we expect to find\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to find that there will be a correlation between being in a relationship and a student's GPA as students in relationships may have more academic, emotional support that could boost mental health and stability leading to higher GPAs **(Vaeth, 2009, p.7-8)**. This is especially when relationship are steady, consequently relationships can be a distraction from studies and lead to a lower GPA when it is unhealthy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings can help other students make an informed decision of about entering or maintaining relationships during their studies. In addition, it could lead to new strategies for schools to support students such as relationship counseling or workshops on balancing personal life with academic responsibilities. **(Lin S. Norton , S. Thomas , K. Morgan , A. Tilley & Thomas E. Dickins (1998))**"

    "### Further Questions\n",
    "What specific aspects of a relationship affect a student's GPA? Is it the emotional support, the time commitment, or some other factor? Perhaps we can also explore how different types of relationships (short-term, long-term etc.) have an effect on GPA."
